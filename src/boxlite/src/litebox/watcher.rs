//! One watcher per box, owning all lifecycle observation.
//!
//! [`BoxWatcher`] always follows the box's shim to its exit — recording
//! `Stopped` and the exit code — and, when a HEALTHCHECK is configured and the
//! guest is reachable, also probes the guest on an interval. It is the single
//! successor to the former split exit-watcher + health-check tasks: a plain box
//! gets an exit-only watcher (`health == None`), a health-checked box gets both
//! from one `select!` loop.
//!
//! Folding the two together also deletes the whole "did the shim die?" branch
//! the health check used to carry: a health tick can only fire while the shim is
//! alive, or `wait_for_exit` would have won the `select!`. So a failed probe is
//! unambiguously a *health* failure — never a dead box — and the exit arm is the
//! single writer of `status` / `exit_code` / `pid`.
