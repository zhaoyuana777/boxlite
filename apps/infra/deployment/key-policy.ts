/*
 * Which keys may cross the boundary between an operator's machine and a stage's shared secret store,
 * in both directions. The allowlist below decides what a store may inject into a deploy; the
 * denylists further down decide what may never be stored in the first place.
 *
 * The keys a stage's secret store may put into a deploy's environment:
 *
 * This started as a denylist of process controls, and seven review rounds each found a new way past
 * it: NODE_OPTIONS, then BASH_ENV and GIT_SSH_COMMAND, then DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_CONTEXT, LD_AUDIT,
 * SST_BUN_PATH, GH_TOKEN, RUSTC_WRAPPER, SSH_ASKPASS. Every one of them turns a stored string into
 * code or a moved trust boundary inside the sst child, which runs Pulumi with the deploy role's
 * credentials. An enumeration of dangerous names cannot be finished, so this is the other shape:
 * nothing is hydrated unless the deploy demonstrably reads it.
 *
 * Derived from the source that reads them — every *direct* `envOr` / `requireEnv` / `process.env.X`
 * under stack/, deployment/, artifacts/, runner/ and shared/, minus the keys isLocalOnlyDeploymentKey
 * refuses. The test beside this file re-derives that set and fails when the two disagree, so adding a
 * config key to the stack fails until it is added here. That failure is the point: it makes widening
 * what a store can inject a decision someone makes, not something that happens.
 *
 * Direct is the operative word, and errs toward refusing. A name passed to a helper that reads it —
 * `runnerEndpoint('DEFAULT_RUNNER_DOMAIN', …)` — is not derived, so it is not storable; the test says
 * why that particular omission is deliberate rather than missed. The failure mode of that choice is a
 * key an operator sets being ignored, which is visible, rather than a key reaching the sst child's
 * environment because a helper obscured it.
 *
 * The denylist stays as a second check. It is not the boundary any more, but a key that is both read
 * by the stack and dangerous — AWS_PROFILE is one — must still be refused.

 * property that matters, not the shape of the rule.
