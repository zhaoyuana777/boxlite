 * Run an `sst` command with the stage's configuration loaded.
 *
 * Values the deployed stack reads through `process.env` / `envOr()` — STACK_DOMAIN, the OIDC
 * settings, the feature toggles, and the Cloudflare provider credentials — cannot be `sst.Secret`:
 * the provider initializes inside `app()` (sst.config.ts) before `run()` exists, and an
 * Output<string> would break every string comparison and `new URL(...)` in stack/*.ts. So they live
 * in the stage's SST secret store as ordinary secrets, and this wrapper reads them back into
 * process.env just before invoking sst. See deployment/stage-config.ts for what may and may not
 * cross that boundary. The app secrets proper (OIDC_CLIENT_ID and friends) are NOT handled here;
 * sst resolves those itself through `sst.Secret`.
 *
 * That store replaced the GitHub Environment secret DEPLOY_ENV, which the deploy workflow used to
 * write out as apps/infra/.env for the length of a job. It is reachable by exactly the people who
 * can already deploy the stage, so local and CI deploys now resolve the same values from the
 * same place.
 *
 * The Cloudflare credentials are the one exception, and they cannot join it. Reading the store
 * initializes every provider `app()` declares, Cloudflare included — `sst secret list` fetches the
 * bootstrap state and then exits with "Cloudflare API not initialized" — so a token stored there
 * would be needed to read itself. They stay in AWS SSM (SecureString, per stage) and are fetched
 * below, before the store is read.
 *
 * The deploy workflow supplies them as Environment secrets rather than relying on this SSM copy.
 * Whether the scoped deploy role could read it is untested: it holds ssm:GetParameter and no
 * identity-based kms:Decrypt, but alias/aws/ssm is an AWS-managed key whose own key policy may admit
 * the account via kms:ViaService, and the role trusts only the GitHub OIDC principal so it cannot be
 * assumed locally to find out. The Environment secrets are what CI has always used; leave it that way
 * until someone measures the alternative from inside a job.
 *
 * Wired into the deploy/remove npm scripts, plus a passthrough:
 *   npm run deploy -- --stage dev      → tsx deployment/sst.ts deploy --stage dev
 *   npm run sst -- diff --stage dev    → any other subcommand
 * `sst dev` is disabled because one long-running process cannot keep its Runner
 * state baseline fresh for every update.
 * A successful deploy is followed by a read-only AWS check that the Proxy NLB
 * listener, ECS target-group attachment, and healthy targets agree.
 *
 * One access gate: a deployer already needs AWS credentials to deploy, and the same credentials
 * decrypt the store — nothing extra to share.
 *
 * A variable already in the environment is used as-is, never overridden by a stored value. That is
 * what keeps the deploy workflow in control of the selectors it sets itself, and it is the escape
 * hatch for a stored value that is wrong.
 *
 * A store that cannot be read stops every command that builds a plan — `diff` included. A preview
 * assembled from defaults is not a preview of the deploy that follows it: the operator approves that
 * plan, the apply then reads the store successfully, and reconciles something nobody reviewed.
 * Commands that need no configuration at all (`install`, `secret`, `unlock`) never read it.
